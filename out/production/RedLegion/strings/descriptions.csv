redlegion_argon_argondelta,CUSTOM,"Argon Delta was a poor choice for colonization and the need for rapid expansion means it was passed over despite any mineral wealth.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonprime,CUSTOM,"Argon Prime was once an independent cryo-volcanic world with heavy industry. Lady Crimson claimed it as payment for her incredible feats as a mercenary and supposedly delivered some device which has terraformed the entire planet. This urbanized world is surprisingly pleasant to live on, if you do not mind the excessive freedoms granted to its citizens and visitors and lax laws.",,,
redlegion_argon_whitecitadel,CUSTOM,"This massive fortress must have been built during the late Domain-era. There is no way such a massive station was built here so quickly... but also no way it could have been moved. The White Citadel is actually covered in a special blue-ish energy absorbent paint, and its name only refers to the iconic central pillar.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonphi,CUSTOM,"Argon Phi is still a poor choice for development and the need for rapid expansion by the Legion means it was passed over despite any mineral wealth.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonbeta,CUSTOM,"Argon Beta was the only habitable planet in the system, originally. Now it is the agricultural power-house behind this capital system.",,,
redlegion_argon_strolluck,CUSTOM,"Strolluck was an extra-solar capture. Supposedly the Red Legion's first order was to push this planet into orbit. If true, this mineral rich planet has proven to have been worthy of such an impossible feat.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonmajoris,CUSTOM,"Argon Majoris is a substantially large gas giant with several notable moons. One day soon the Red Legion will setup a fueling station here, but for now they import most of their fuel.",,,
redlegion_argon_fieldro,CUSTOM,"Fieldro is so named because of the pirate captain who made her last stand here, fighting to claim Frederick Crimson's life while he stood guard over the system, awaiting the return of his wife.",,,
redlegion_argon_yawsplu,CUSTOM,"Yawsplu has some potential, but is unlikely to see development until Argon Majoris is being exploited.",,,
redlegion_argon_douven,CUSTOM,"Douven got its name when a pirate base was established here. In a bid for power, the newly enriched Crimson Guard Centurion Douven challenged the base commander's entire fleet with only his high-tech cruiser. Elleven grueling minutes later, the pirates surrendered and the base was assimilated into the Blood Keep further out in orbit.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonGamma,CUSTOM,"Argon Gamma is a stark reminder to the Red Legion and its enemies that they are just as fallible as any other Human. Once a thriving colony during the first wave of the Legion's expansion, this world was annihilated by the Hegemony. While not as ideal as a conquest, the Legion could not protect all of its territory and was punished accordingly for their error.",,,
redlegion_argon_bloodkeep,CUSTOM,"This High-Tech station acts as the outer most defensive operating base for Legion forces in their home system. Containing advanced military facilities, heavy shields and energy weapons, it even boasts comfortable lodging for the special order of Blood Knights who operate patrols from the base.",,,
redlegion_argon_hye_steel,CUSTOM,"Hye-Steel is a useful and interesting world, with some evidence of previous colonization. Unfortunately it is just too far out to be useful yet...",,,
redlegion,FACTION,"Bandits roam about looking for the vulnerable who have something valuable. They take these to sustain themselves, but like an early hunter-gatherer this is inefficient for long term growth or survival. In time, a bandit will discover a place which provides them with everything they need. They set up shop, using their predilection for violence to protect their new home. These stationary bandits become kings, lords, and despots. Now they cannot flee from trouble - they must protect their investments and so they create laws and alliances. Now they are a polity. They create civilization.

One such former 'mercenary' was Sable Crimson. After taking an impossible contract and completing it, the independent world of Argon Prime, which hired her, could not pay. Instead, she took their planet and began exploiting it for her own needs. In time 'former associates' came seeking their cut, and conflict ensued. Seeing such terrible troubles, Lady Crimson ventured out to the rim in search of answers. In this time her husband, Frederick, was nearly killed and much of the Crimson Guard was destroyed protecting what little was theirs.

Nigh upon the hour of their defeat did Lady Crimson return with a terrible and unknown warship. She crushed the fleets of the invaders and setup a new government.

Her military oligarchy, the Red Legion, was formed from her former Crimson Guard with herself and her husband at the head. They struck out at once to conquer near-by worlds and even settle a few new ones. They roamed far to strike pirate outposts for the materials needed to establish basic infrastructure. The Red Legion's well-guarded freeports attracted many immigrants. In a short time they grew to be a somewhat dangerous player in the events of the Sector.

It was leaked last year that Hegemony Intelligence has long suspected the Red Legion has been using AI to bolster their administrative capabilities, and their ship production clearly involves a nano-forge with newly recovered blueprints. The Hegemony invasion began after only a cycle of the formation of the Red Legion. During this time the Red Legion used its special flagship and supporting fleet of advanced ships like a wrecking ball. With so many threats already in the sector, the Hegemony was forced to adopt a more passive 'wait and see' initiative for an opportune chance to strike.

The Red Legion expanded to encompass four star systems. They began to trade technology with corporate interests such as Tri-Tachyon. They continued to funnel material and ships into pirate and independent forces through free ports. They attracted a lot of Luddic Pather interest. They even located an old orbital ship-yard from the Domain-era. After this discovery leaked, the Hegemony decided it was the time to strike. With so many fronts open and the Red Legion stretched thin the Hegemony Expeditionary Fleet pushed in to seize the ship-yard. Even now, the battle rages on.

The Red Legion represents a medium sized polity on the brink of either greatness, or failure. Be it a stronghold to conquer to strengthen your own growing realm, or a source of new technologies and plentiful salvage from their many conflicts, it will surely prove useful. Perhaps you're looking for a new job? The Red Legion always has room for new commissioned officers; just remember that trust is at an all time premium.",,,
