redlegion_antagonist,SHIP,"This clear design iteration on the kite has advanced it with high-tech updates. The Antagonist was designed as a civilian shuttle, but the Red Legion has bolted missile hardpoint extensions onto either side to fulfill auxiliary wartime roles. Its only real advantage is its speed.",,,
redlegion_bloodseeker,SHIP,"Designed to chase down fleeing enemies and groups of two or three, the Blood Seeker is fast, even for a light frigate. Light frigates are often overlooked by junior captains who are less judicious with deployment and assignment. Able to apply pressure, relieve another ship who is out of position, or run down fleeing pirates, the Blood Seeker is well built for rapid, short-range strikes. Given its logistical limitations and short deployment time, it is best to either lead an attack with a group of Blood Seekers, or keep them in reserve where their high speed will allow them to quickly join the fight where they are needed most. Cheap, expendable, and fast, it lacks any civilian application and often makes a poor escort on its own.",,,
redlegion_argon_argondelta,CUSTOM,"Argon Delta was a poor choice for colonization and the need for rapid expansion means it was passed over despite any mineral wealth.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonprime,CUSTOM,"Argon Prime was once an independent cryo-volcanic world with heavy industry. Lady Crimson claimed it as payment for her incredible feats as a mercenary and supposedly delivered some device which has terraformed the entire planet. This urbanized world is surprisingly pleasant to live on, if you do not mind the excessive freedoms granted to its citizens and visitors and lax laws.",,"This planet has an entire working Earth-like ecosystem and small ad-brochures play on the local nets. Conversely, planetary survey charts suggest this should be a cryo-volcanic world. Well, the millions down below certainly could attest to the pleasant climate...",
redlegion_argon_whitecitadel,CUSTOM,"This massive fortress must have been built during the late Domain-era. There is no way such a massive station was built here so quickly... but also no way it could have been moved. The White Citadel is actually covered in a special blue-ish energy absorbent paint, and its name only refers to the iconic central pillar.",,"The fortress is even more intimidating up close. It looks like a massive high-tech star fortress, however, it has some sort of huge, white, reflective pillar piercing through its center. You wonder what that could possibly be as your ship's scanner just bounces off of it.",
redlegion_argon_argonphi,CUSTOM,"Argon Phi is still a poor choice for development and the need for rapid expansion by the Legion means it was passed over despite any mineral wealth.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonbeta,CUSTOM,"Argon Beta was the only habitable planet in the system, originally. Now it is the agricultural power-house behind this capital system.",,"Below you is a scene out of a movie about terraformers and bright futures. Impossibly large expanses of farmland and irrigation give way to clusters of commercial centers, each decorated with well groomed gardens and accented with cloisters of trees. Your comms officer, helm, and others step over for a moment to admire the view with you before returning to duty.",
redlegion_argon_strolluck,CUSTOM,"Strolluck was an extra-solar capture. Supposedly the Red Legion's first order was to push this planet into orbit. If true, this mineral rich planet has proven to have been worthy of such an impossible feat.",,"Looking out your starship's viewport, you can see the expansive surface strip-mining on Strolluck. There are terrible rents through the ground, and the few mountains are being stripped away entirely. In the distance you can see massive ravines carved into the planet's crust. 'Progress' the ad-holos for the planet assure you.",
redlegion_argon_argonmajoris,CUSTOM,"Argon Majoris is a substantially large gas giant with several notable moons. One day soon the Red Legion will setup a fueling station here, but for now they import most of their fuel.",,,
redlegion_argon_fieldro,CUSTOM,"Fieldro is so named because of the pirate captain who made her last stand here, fighting to claim Frederick Crimson's life while he stood guard over the system, awaiting the return of his wife.",,,
redlegion_argon_yawsplu,CUSTOM,"Yawsplu has some potential, but is unlikely to see development until Argon Majoris is being exploited.",,,
redlegion_argon_douven,CUSTOM,"Douven got its name when a pirate base was established here. In a bid for power, the newly enriched Crimson Guard Centurion Douven challenged the base commander's entire fleet with only his high-tech cruiser. Elleven grueling minutes later, the pirates surrendered and the base was assimilated into the Blood Keep further out in orbit.",,,
redlegion_argon_argonGamma,CUSTOM,"Argon Gamma is a stark reminder to the Red Legion and its enemies that they are just as fallible as any other Human. Once a thriving colony during the first wave of the Legion's expansion, this world was annihilated by the Hegemony. While not as ideal as a conquest, the Legion could not protect all of its territory and was punished accordingly for their error.",,,
redlegion_argon_bloodkeep,CUSTOM,"This High-Tech station acts as the outer most defensive operating base for Legion forces in their home system. Containing advanced military facilities, heavy shields and energy weapons, it even boasts comfortable lodging for the special order of Blood Knights who operate patrols from the base.",,"The station practically bristles with energy weapons and glimmers behind shield barriers. Dozens of white and red escort craft make their patrols along the edges of the system from here.",
redlegion_argon_hye_steel,CUSTOM,"Hye-Steel is a useful and interesting world, with some evidence of previous colonization. Unfortunately it is just too far out to be useful yet...",,,
redlegion_tradewind_redmond,CUSTOM,"Redmond has a weak magnetic field and no atmosphere. As such, its position so close to Tradewind means it has soaked up solar radiation for eons.",,,
redlegion_tradewind_jabez,CUSTOM,"This barren world glimmers with shattered hab-domes visible across much of the cold, vvacuous surface.",,"Jabez was a largely unremarkable planet until the Luddic Church first took it over. Building hab-blocks around the massive half-buried cities of an old Dominion colony, they began a demolition effort to cleanse the 'artifacts of evil'.",
redlegion_tradewind_vlasta,CUSTOM,"Vlasta appears to be what is left of a much larger planet. Evidence shows it was once not only a large Domain city-planet, but that there was rich bio-diverse life. Why or how the planet was bombarded into an asteroid belt and lifeless rock is lost to history.",,,
redlegion_tradewind_tanda,CUSTOM,"A substantial gas-giant, Tanda would not normally be ideal for habitation. Elements necessary for volatile fuel production are in abundance here.",,"The generous fuel production possibilities make it an important resource despite the risks. A Red Legion incentives program offered to colonists for this critical outpost created enough population rush to grow to a moderate size. It is still an extremely inhospitable habitat for Humans. As such, the majority of the planet's surface, barely visible even through your scanners, is left untouched. Instead, a singular and massive underground network has allowed life to thrive in the heavy gravity under the heavy starport.",
redlegion_tradewind_siraj,CUSTOM,"Siraj is the only substantial moon around Tana, and offers a useful colony and meaningful trade outpost for anyone looking to discretely interact with the Red Legion whilst they occupy the gas giant.",,"The Domain would have loved to terraform a planet like this - despite the endless shimmering desert there is wealth beneath those sands. Given gradual bombardment by ice asteroids and a solar-shade or three, the Domain would have turned this into a somewhat pleasant place to live. Perhaps they tried, once. Ruins stretch over much of the planet, a few dense groupings buried by centuries of sand storms.

Your helm officer jokes with you 'I wanna give up all this life in space, and go sifting around through a whole planet of sand in the hopes of finding lost technology and getting rich! Hah, yeah right.' Given the population figures, however, someone does believe it to be worthwhile.",
redlegion_tradewind_ervar,CUSTOM,"Built by Luddites as a 'Bastion of Galactic Redemption' this lowtech station serves as a population center, religious site, and military outpost for the search and destroy efforts of any tech-remnants in system. It also serves as a foil to the Red Legion's efforts.",,"Heavy, steel, red. Those three words describe most post-collapse stations and this one is no different. It does see a decent bit of traffic despite not having any sort of open market.",
redlegion_tradewind_koen,CUSTOM,"A distant ice-ball never-the-less covered with ruins. This inhospitable world may have once been very different than the lifeless frozen orb it is today.",,,
tradewind_platform,CUSTOM,"An abandoned station hidden in a cloud of useless asteroids. This might be a nice place to stash somethings out of the way...",,"This abandoned station still has some basic power functions. Its computers are burned out, as are any weapon emplacements that haven't been looted decades ago. The superstructure is voluminous, however. Could be a good place to stash your stuff, even ships!",
redlegion,FACTION,"Bandits roam about looking for the vulnerable who have something valuable. They take these to sustain themselves, but like an early hunter-gatherer this is inefficient for long term growth or survival. In time, a bandit will discover a place which provides them with everything they need. They set up shop, using their predilection for violence to protect their new home. These stationary bandits become kings, lords, and despots. Now they cannot flee from trouble - they must protect their investments and so they create laws and alliances. Now they are a polity. They create civilization.

One such former 'mercenary' was Sable Crimson. After taking an impossible contract and completing it, the independent world of Argon Prime, which hired her, could not pay. Instead, she took their planet and began exploiting it for her own needs. In time 'former associates' came seeking their cut, and conflict ensued. Seeing such terrible troubles, Lady Crimson ventured out to the rim in search of answers. In this time her husband, Frederick, was nearly killed and much of the Crimson Guard was destroyed protecting what little was theirs.

Nigh upon the hour of their defeat did Lady Crimson return with a terrible and unknown warship. She crushed the fleets of the invaders and setup a new government.

Her military oligarchy, the Red Legion, was formed from her former Crimson Guard with herself and her husband at the head. They struck out at once to conquer near-by worlds and even settle a few new ones. They roamed far to strike pirate outposts for the materials needed to establish basic infrastructure. The Red Legion's well-guarded freeports attracted many immigrants. In a short time they grew to be a somewhat dangerous player in the events of the Sector.

It was leaked last year that Hegemony Intelligence has long suspected the Red Legion has been using AI to bolster their administrative capabilities, and their ship production clearly involves a nano-forge with newly recovered blueprints. The Hegemony invasion began after only a cycle of the formation of the Red Legion. During this time the Red Legion used its special flagship and supporting fleet of advanced ships like a wrecking ball. With so many threats already in the sector, the Hegemony was forced to adopt a more passive 'wait and see' initiative for an opportune chance to strike.

The Red Legion expanded to encompass four star systems. They began to trade technology with corporate interests such as Tri-Tachyon. They continued to funnel material and ships into pirate and independent forces through free ports. They attracted a lot of Luddic Pather interest. They even located an old orbital ship-yard from the Domain-era. After this discovery leaked, the Hegemony decided it was the time to strike. With so many fronts open and the Red Legion stretched thin the Hegemony Expeditionary Fleet pushed in to seize the ship-yard. Even now, the battle rages on.

The Red Legion represents a medium sized polity on the brink of either greatness, or failure. Be it a stronghold to conquer to strengthen your own growing realm, or a source of new technologies and plentiful salvage from their many conflicts, it will surely prove useful. Perhaps you're looking for a new job? The Red Legion always has room for new commissioned officers; just remember that trust is at an all time premium.",,,
