flavorTextMarketArgonPrime,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == redlegion
$market.id == argon_prime_market","AddText ""The marketplace is a vast multi-story hub of commerce. High tech displays show ad-holos and brilliant lights cast the building with garish colors. People from much of the sector can be seen haggling and browsing wears. A number of small high-tech space ships land in the middle of the hub set to blaring music and fanfare! Ad-holos spring up all around the dazzling personal vehicles."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""There are Red Legion guards patrolling the area, remarkable in their stark white with blood-red trimmed uniforms. You can buy nearly anything here, it is just a matter of finding it."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

flavorTextMarketArgonWhiteCitadel,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == redlegion
$market.id == argon_white_citadel_market","AddText ""First you must pass by heavy security checkpoints with weapons fortifications and huge batteries before being allowed inside. The neat interior past the docks is stark yet efficiently used. There are military wears available if you have the connections to be allowed to browse them - after all, only a friend of the Red Legion could buy this advanced tech or tap into the surplus stockpiles. You get the distinct feeling you are being followed - obviously they want to keep an eye on you in their fortification, but you cannot shake the feeling there is someone here you cannot see."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""The interior is seamless and clean, yet you suspect the numerous alcoves and small indentations hide the heavy defenses that make this such a formidable mix of low and high tech - turrets hang from the ceiling suspended by unseen forces, yet guards with heavy ammunition dependant weapons stand by the doors."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

flavorTextMarketArgonStrolluck,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == redlegion
$market.id == argon_strolluck_market","AddText ""Merchants go about their business in the busy concourse. A constant din of voices and the distant thunder of heavy machinery remind you this is a mining colony first and foremost. Despite this, attention has been given to the concourse, with a neat and tidy layout making efficient use of space."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""Guards in uniforms of stark white with blood-red trim are on patrol. Some stand in red-painted zones, marking restricted areas. One gives you a friendly wave, heavy pulse-rifle strapped to their back."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

flavorTextMarketArgonBeta,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == redlegion
$market.id == argon_beta_market","AddText ""Stepping out of the space port you are beset by a gorgeous valley of lush greenery. Flowers and trees have been cultivated into a lush garden for a grand and natural concourse filled with merchants neatly spaced out. The planet supposedly gets almost five hundred days of sunshine. The nearby irrigation system is tremendous and hums along rhythmically to birdsong. Today is a particularly warm and lovely day, with merchants haggling and children playing in the decorative fountain."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""Only the glimpse of stark white uniforms with blood-red trim reminds you of the heavy military presence neatly tucked away, just within view and ready to respond. One gives you a friendly wave, pulse-rifle strapped to his back."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

flavorTextMarketArgonBloodKeep,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == redlegion
$market.id == argon_blood_keep_market","AddText ""A flexible umbilical automatically connects to your ship as you dock, allowing for an easy if slightly cramped walk into the interior. Passing through a heavy, semi-transparent material force-field, you step out into the customs area. The station interior is just as stark white as the crisp military uniforms of the guards and customs agents who process you in. The blood-red accents reflect off the lights and cast a slight haze of red about the room as you are allowed further in to the market area."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""Every bit the military surplus super-store you've ever seen - there are stacks and heaped piles of materials. A quarter master moves about with a team of heavy guards, organizing and presenting weaponry to customers. Standing off to the side is a thin man in uniform with a small shuttle who can show you the surplus military ships available to those who have made in-roads with the Red Legion. The whole area is monitored by cameras, turrets, a few hovering drones who move about with a dull hum. A large military assault robot thrums with energy over near the loading zone. Best go about your business."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

flavorTextMarketJabezLudd,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == luddic_church
$market.id == jabez_market","AddText ""The spaceport itself is simple and heavyset in construction. The entire market is connected to it via steel and glass pedestrian tubes that keep the vacuum at bay and polarize the harsh sunlight. The marketplace itself seems like it was built into the circular hole left by a massive excavation effort cut into the very crust of the planet. Markets and hewn footpaths sprawl in all directions from here across the 'gap'."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""Luddic symbols and colors decorate this market. It is a sea of people here to catch a glimmer of craftsmanship, exotic goods, or sell their hard-wrought goods. The people are down to Earth and direct yet polite."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

AddText ""White and Red coloration and the inverted diamond symbols of the Red Legion decorate this market. It is a sea of people here to catch a glimmer of craftsmanship, exotic goods, or sell their hard-wrought goods. Anything could be bought here, for a price."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

flavorTextMarketTandaRed,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$faction.id == redlegion
$market.id == tanda_market","AddText ""This 'megaport' of a starport has dozens of landing pads neatly set apart on large suspended platforms. After landing, yours is enclosed in a dome and the atmosphere pumped out to allow nitrogen-oxygen to be pumped in. A warning system tells you to stay in your space-suit until you are inside the concourse."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""This massive concourse is a glorious capitalistic marketplace of weapons, goods, and exotics. Primarily a fueling depot, this is also clearly a trade hub for the Legion. Different companies compete to sell the complex fuel produced in absolutely incredible amounts here on Tanda. The whole area is monitored by cameras, turrets, a few hovering drones who move about with a dull hum. A large military assault robot thrums with energy over near the loading zone. At least you're not likely to be mugged in the concourse..."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

A warning system tells you to stay in your space-suit until you are inside the concourse."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""This massive concourse is a sprawling marketplace of handmade goods. The banners of the Luddic church of Galactic Redemption hang from on high. Complex technical systems have been replaced by crude yet reliable circuits and manually operated systems as is Ludd's vision. Primarily a fueling depot, you can purchase large volumes of the complex fuel produced in absolutely incredible amounts here on Tanda. The people here are somewhat quiet for a marketplace, and you find them pleasant if curt to interact with."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

$faction.id == tritachyon
$market.id == siraj_market","AddText ""Harsh winds of heavy sand make for a noisy if largely uneventful landing. The spaceport is a reasonably contained if showy design with bright lighting and numerous ad-holos and displays with advertising or local news, weather, and stocks. It is only a short walk down to the marketplace."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""Even all the way out here Tri-Tachyon does not fail to impress. A sprawling open-concept bar dominated the very center of the market with a holo-band hovering above it. The lighting near the ceiling is blended with holo-projectors to create a dazzling display of advertisements coming in and out of the artificial sky-like display. Small store-fronts cover every wall and crevice, each demanding your attention with signs, lights, sound, and an aurora of displays."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

It is only a short walk down to the marketplace."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""Evidently the Red Legion has made some 'upgrades' to the original Tri-Tachyon setup. A sprawling open-concept bar still dominates the very center of the market but now includes a vast seating area with a stage where entertainers keep the drunk soldiers and workers distracted from the tough frontier living. The lighting near the ceiling is blended with holo-projectors to create a dazzling display of Red Legion ships coming in and out of the artificial sky-like display in a show of naval might. Small store-fronts cover every wall and crevice, each demanding your attention with signs, lights, smells, sound, and an aurora of displays."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

The spaceport is a reasonably contained if showy design with bright lighting and all the numerous ad-holos and displays with advertising removed. In their place, the devotions of Ludd have been placed for all to see. It is only a short walk down to the marketplace."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""The Church of Galactic Redemption have done some cleanup of the original Tri-Tachyon setup. A sprawling open shrine dominates the very center of the market where a priest speaks on the joy of simple living and the rewarding life of hard labor. The lighting near the ceiling is blended with holo-projectors to create a slow-moving display of Luddic devotionals and iconography to insipire the faithful. Small store-fronts cover every wall and crevice, each decorated plainly and clearly by function."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

$faction.id == luddic_church
$market.id == ervar_market","AddText ""A massive concrete and steel tube connects to your ship as you dock, requiring slight manual adjustments to reach alignment. It is a cramped yet very secure space, and a thankfully short walk into the interior. A secure area of Luddic soldiers watch you pass by as you step out into the customs area. The station interior is all heavy steel and cabling with open, functional spaces. The entire place is spartan and utilitarian. You pass by several marines before being allowed into the market."" marketFlavorTextColor
AddText ""The Luddic Church takes its tenants seriously. A few quiet guards and a stern looking quartermaster stand by a spartan steel desk before crates of neatly marked inventory. Standing next to him is a naval ensign in uniform with a small shuttle who can show you the surplus ships available to those who have made great efforts towards Galactic Redemption. The whole area is monitored by a quartet of marines."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,

AddText ""The Red Legion has made good use of the available space. Weapons, crates of drugs, and other materials are crammed into every available square foot. A few guards in crisp white and red uniforms give you a smile, but watch you carefully from their posts. A businessman stands by a lovely oak desk before open crates of heavy weaponry as if on display. Standing next to him is a friendly woman in uniform with a small shuttle who can show you the surplus ships available to those who have made friends with the Red Legion. The whole area is monitored by cameras and a quietly humming war robot anchored to the ceiling."" marketFlavorTextColor",,,
